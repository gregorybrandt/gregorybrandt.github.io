            <p>Brandt has worked as a substitute teacher and a long-term substitute teacher at over a dozen different high schools and middle schools in Honolulu, Hawaii. Gregory was a great teacher. He only received positive reviews from parents and administrators. However, he was forced to stop teaching due to the attention he recieved from a toxic LIVE streamer and his toxic community. Brandt made the mistake of inviting him and his network of trash friends to Hawaii after reading an article in the New Yorker magazine about him.

            <p>Gregory has worked at five different organic farms learning how to grow, harvest and seed a wide variety of fruits and vegetables. Brandt has learned to grow food under many different climates and circumstances. Because of a strong work ethic and good leadership skills, Gregory was made manager of every farm he worked at. He learned how to build green houses in New Mexico and wrote a government grant for the farm’s greenhouse. Gregory has also learned how to grow food in the snowy winters in the Sierra Nevada’s with “hoop houses.” He learned how to grow delicious fruit in Hawaii when farming in a tropical environment, and he built a farm from scratch for an ungrateful disabled kid in Vancouver.</p>

            <p>When Gregory first moved to Hawaii, he worked on a farm and was made farm manager. He left the farm and worked as a caregiver for six months. After that he was employed by a Honolulu Staffing agency. Brandt has always been a very hard worker, so it didn’t take long before Gregory was in demand all over the island. Gregory worked for the company on and off for three years and was sent to dozens of different kinds of jobs all around the island. It gave him an opportunity to learn about the wide variety of climates, communities, and people on Oahu.</p>

Before we can accept change, we must recognize their is need for change. No one is perfect, but working hard and staying dedicated to our dreams, is the true meaning of success. Gregory’s book “Gonzo Education,” expresses these beliefs. What we ‘need’ tells us who we are. What we ‘want’ tells us who we want to be. Therefore, we pursue what we ‘want’ because we don’t want to face who we are."</div>
